# Be The Hero (Front-end)

Connects people to ONGs with love ðŸš€

## Idea

Following the Semana Oministack 11.0 application development, we're building a app to connect people with ONGs what can be a good tool after some improvements.

## Main Purpose (Technical)

- Be the interface application that fully uses back-end features and converts it to visual features

## Prerequisites

- Node version 13.11.0
- Yarn globally installed (`npm install -g yarn`)
- Jest globally installed (`npm install -g jest`)
- ESLint installed on IDE and globally (`npm install -g eslint`)
- Prettier installed globally (`npm install -g prettier`)

## For tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## For application debug (using DEV profile)

```bash
yarn debug
```

## For lint check and quick fixes

```bash
yarn eslintfy
```

## For run application

```bash
yarn {profile}
```

{profile} can be `prod` or `dev`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
